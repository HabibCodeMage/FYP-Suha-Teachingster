It is created on one or more columns of a table and contains a sorted list of values from those columns. The primary advantage of using indexes is that they can speed up the retrieval of data from a table by quickly locating the records that match a certain query. Indexes can also be used to enforce unique constraints and referential integrity constraints between tables. However, indexes require additional storage space and can slow down the performance of insert, update, and delete operations on a table.",

        "text": "Indexes play a crucial role in the performance of insert, update, and delete operations on a table. Whenever a row is inserted, updated, or deleted, each associated index needs to be modified to reflect the changes. This means that for every operation, the database engine must not only update the table but also update all relevant indexes. This additional index maintenance overhead can significantly slow down these operations, especially if the table has a large number of indexes. Therefore, when considering the use of indexes, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of index-based query optimization and the potential impact on the performance of data modification operations.",

Rather than rewriting the same code for each application, developers can leverage existing stored procedures, which are already tested and optimized.

Explicit cursors can further be categorized into two types: static and dynamic cursors. A static cursor retrieves a snapshot of data when it is opened, and any changes made to the underlying data are not visible to the cursor. On the other hand, a dynamic cursor retrieves data in real-time, meaning that any changes made to the underlying data are immediately visible to the cursor. Dynamic cursors provide more up-to-date information but can be more resource-intensive than static cursors.",
